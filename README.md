# Spotify_clone
This is a simple Spotify Clone built using HTML and CSS. It's my first project, created to practice front-end development. The layout is inspired by Spotify and is slightly responsive. Through this project, I learned how to structure web pages and style them using CSS. I plan to improve it further by adding interactivity and making it fully responsive in the future.
